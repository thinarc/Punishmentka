# TextTween

**TextTween** is a lightweight Unity library designed to animate [TextMesh Pro (TMP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.textmeshpro@latest) texts with high performance. It leverages Unity's **Job System** and **Burst Compiler** to deliver smooth and efficient character-level animations.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 High-performance character animation using **Jobs** and **Burst**
- 🔠 Fine-grained control over individual TMP characters
- 🎮 Easy to integrate into existing Unity projects
- 🧩 Lightweight and dependency-free (except TMP)

## 🚀 Usage

![](EditorResources/image_00.png)

1. Start by adding **TweenManager** to your text.
2. Bind the text to **Texts** property.
3. Add modifier components to a game object and add them to the list of **Modifiers**. Re-arrange the modifiers to change the order of modification. 

### Modifiers
#### 1.Interval Modifier
![](EditorResources/interval_ss.png)

Changes the character intervals by either overlapping or differing them. 

#### 2.Transform Modifier

![](EditorResources/transform_ss.png)

Allows you to modify letters position, scale or rotation according to curve over progress of TweenManager.

- Curve: Add easing to progress propagated by tween manager.
- Type: Shows the value to modify(position, rotation or scale).
- Scale: Dimension mask for scale operation.
- Intensity: Amount of change per axis.
- Pivot: Pivot point of transformation.

#### 3.Color Modifier

Lets to change the color of letters over time.

- Gradient: The colors that will be interpolated according to progress.

#### 4.Warp Modifier
![](EditorResources/warp.gif)
![](EditorResources/warp_ss.png)

Warps the lines of text according to intensity and curve provided over progress. The intensity is multiplied by the curve value and applied to letters as Y displacement.

- Intensity: Amount of displacement
- Warp Curve: Curve to be used by modifier
